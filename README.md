# RCRS-Simulator
 An addition to the repository found at https://github.com/abdalla1912mohamed/Deep_reinforcement_learning_Bachelor_project/tree/main

NOTE: Some of this is not our code, the files we have created ourselves are:
Dyna_Q_NoRandom (but this is just taking some code out of Dyna_Q)
Dyna_Q2
Dyna_Q3

This project is a pathfinding simulation, where the seeker is not provided a map of the environment, and must instead trial-and-error to avoid walls and find its way to the target goal. There are a few different algorithms, some provided by the original author, some created by us. The goal of the project is to create better alternatives to the algorithms created by the original author, and to show improvement metrics. This is explained in more detail in our presentation slides.

Setup:
To run this project, you may first have to download some dependencies. There is a setup script inside the "Python Codes" folder, which when run should install all if not nearly everything you need for running. Additionally, running any of the scripts will tell you what you are missing as an error, but here is a list:
Python

Instructions to run each algorithm:
Open up the "Python Codes" folder in the Terminal. From here, you can run each of the following scripts with python ______.py where the blank space is name of the script. This is a list of the scripts relevant to our project and presentation:
Dyna_Q (Made by original author)
Dyna_Q3 (Made by us)
DQN (Made by original author)
//Put name of your script here

Each of these scripts has some alternative options when running. First, there is a line near the top
